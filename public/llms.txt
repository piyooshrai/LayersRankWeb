# LayersRank — AI Hiring Intelligence Platform

> LayersRank is a confidence-weighted hiring infrastructure platform built for engineering and technical recruiting. We use structured interviews, explainable AI scoring, and fuzzy-logic confidence intervals to help GCCs, enterprises, and startups make defensible, consistent hiring decisions.

## What We Do

LayersRank delivers AI-powered candidate assessment that is:
- Structured: every candidate receives the same adaptive question sequence
- Explainable: every score includes an evidence trail, not just a number
- Unbiased: models evaluate responses, not pedigree — names, colleges, and company brands are not visible to scoring models
- Defensible: all decisions are documented for audit review

## Core Product Features

- Structured Interviews: role-specific question banks with adaptive follow-up
- Confidence Scoring: Bayesian confidence intervals on every competency score
- Adaptive Questioning: when confidence is low, the system generates clarifying follow-ups
- Integrity Detection: automated inconsistency and contradiction flagging
- Candidate Reports: audit-ready dossiers exportable to PDF or ATS

## The Science

LayersRank is built on three research pillars:
1. Fuzzy Logic: candidate quality exists on a spectrum; binary pass/fail is a lossy representation
2. Explainable AI: every hiring decision must be auditable — we output evidence, not black-box scores
3. Bias Mitigation: pedigree-neutral evaluation; models cannot see names, photos, educational institutions, or employer brands
