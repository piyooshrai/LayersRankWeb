## THE FRONTEND HIRING CHALLENGE

Frontend engineering has evolved dramatically. It's no longer just HTML/CSS — it's state management, build systems, performance optimization, accessibility, and bridging design and backend.

The challenge: many candidates know frameworks but lack fundamentals. They can build a React component but can't debug why it re-renders 50 times.

**Common hiring mistakes:**

- **Framework fixation.** Testing React knowledge instead of UI engineering principles. Frameworks change; fundamentals don't.
- **Ignoring performance thinking.** Anyone can make it work. Great frontend engineers make it fast.
- **Skipping accessibility.** It's not optional. It's legal requirement and good engineering.
- **Missing design collaboration skills.** Frontend engineers are the bridge between design and implementation.

## SAMPLE FRONTEND ENGINEER QUESTIONS

### Technical Questions

**1. Walk me through how you would architect a complex form with validation, error handling, and good UX. What decisions would you make and why?**

*What this reveals:* Component architecture thinking, state management approach, attention to user experience details.

**2. You notice a page is slow to load and janky when scrolling. How would you diagnose and fix it?**

*What this reveals:* Performance debugging methodology, familiarity with browser dev tools, understanding of rendering pipeline.

**3. How do you decide what to build as a reusable component versus a one-off implementation?**

*What this reveals:* Judgment about abstraction, awareness of over-engineering risks, pragmatism.

### Behavioral Questions

**4. Tell me about a time you had to push back on a design that was technically problematic. How did you handle it?**

*What this reveals:* Design collaboration skills, ability to communicate technical constraints, relationship management.

**5. Describe a situation where you had to implement something before fully understanding the requirements. What was your approach?**

*What this reveals:* Handling ambiguity, communication with stakeholders, iterative development mindset.

## FRONTEND ENGINEER EVALUATION CRITERIA

| Competency | What Great Looks Like | Red Flags |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Component Design** | Thinks about reusability, clear prop interfaces, separation of concerns | Monolithic components, prop drilling everywhere, no composition |
| **Performance** | Proactive about optimization, measures before changing, understands browser | Ignores performance, premature optimization, no measurement |
| **CSS Architecture** | Organized approach, responsive thinking, manageable specificity | Inline styles everywhere, !important abuse, no system |
| **Design Collaboration** | Respects design intent, communicates constraints, attention to detail | Dismissive of design, pixel-off implementations, no feedback loop |
| **Accessibility** | Considers a11y from start, tests with assistive tech, semantic HTML | "We'll add a11y later", div soup, no ARIA awareness |

---

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Configure your frontend assessment** — Use our template or customize for your framework/stack
2. **Invite candidates** — They complete the assessment async (30-40 min)
3. **Review reports** — See scores with confidence intervals across all dimensions
4. **Make better decisions** — Know exactly where candidates excel or need probing

**Time to first assessment:** Under 10 minutes

## FAQ

**How long does the frontend assessment take candidates?**
30-40 minutes. Mix of video responses (architecture discussions, problem-solving) and written responses (technical explanations).

**What if we use Vue/Angular instead of React?**
The default assessment focuses on frontend principles that apply across frameworks. You can customize for specific framework questions.

**Do you test CSS skills?**
We evaluate CSS architecture thinking and approach rather than syntax recall. The goal is understanding how they organize and maintain styles.

**How does this compare to take-home coding projects?**
LayersRank is faster (30-40 min vs. hours), more standardized, and evaluates judgment alongside implementation. Many teams use LayersRank first, then short take-home for finalists.
