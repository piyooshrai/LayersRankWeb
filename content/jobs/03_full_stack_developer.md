## THE FULL STACK HIRING CHALLENGE

"Full stack" means different things at different companies. Sometimes it's "backend engineer who can touch CSS." Sometimes it's "frontend engineer who can write API endpoints." Sometimes it's a genuine end-to-end generalist.

The challenge: breadth vs. depth. True full stack developers are rare. Many candidates claim full stack but are really specialists with exposure to the other side.

**Common hiring mistakes:**

- **Accepting shallow breadth.** "I've used React" doesn't mean they can architect a frontend. "I know Node" doesn't mean they can design a database schema.
- **Testing depth in one area only.** You interview their strong side, assume the weak side is fine. It's not.
- **Ignoring integration thinking.** Full stack value is connecting systems. If they think in silos, they're not full stack.
- **Missing product sense.** Full stack developers often work closer to product. Technical skill without product thinking limits impact.

*What this reveals:* Cross-stack debugging methodology, understanding of data flow, systematic troubleshooting.

**3. How do you decide when to handle something on the frontend vs. the backend?**

*What this reveals:* Judgment about architecture trade-offs, understanding of security/performance implications, pragmatism.

## FULL STACK EVALUATION CRITERIA

| Competency | What Great Looks Like | Red Flags |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Backend Depth** | Can design schemas, write efficient queries, understand system design | Only knows ORM, no raw SQL, can't discuss scalability |
| **Frontend Depth** | Understands rendering, state management, can debug UI issues | Just uses frameworks blindly, no CSS understanding |
| **Integration** | Thinks about API contracts, data validation, error handling across stack | Treats frontend/backend as separate problems |
| **Product Sense** | Asks about user impact, makes pragmatic trade-offs, ships iteratively | Overbuilds, no user empathy, gold-plating |
| **Autonomy** | Unblocks themselves, asks good questions, owns outcomes | Waits for direction, blames blockers, needs hand-holding |

---

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Configure your full stack assessment** — Adjust depth for frontend vs. backend based on your needs
2. **Invite candidates** — They complete the assessment async (35-45 min)
3. **Review reports** — See scores across both stacks plus behavioral dimensions
4. **Make better decisions** — Know exactly where candidates are strong vs. shallow

**Time to first assessment:** Under 10 minutes

## FAQ

**How do you evaluate both frontend and backend in one assessment?**
Our full stack assessment includes questions from both domains, weighted based on your configuration. You see separate scores for each area.

**What if we need someone stronger in backend?**
Adjust the dimension weights. 60% backend, 25% frontend, 15% behavioral — whatever matches your actual role.

**How long does the assessment take?**
35-45 minutes. Longer than specialist assessments because we're covering more ground.

**What tech stacks do you cover?**
Questions focus on principles over specific technologies. You can customize to add stack-specific questions.
