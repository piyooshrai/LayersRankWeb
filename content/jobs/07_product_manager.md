## THE PM HIRING CHALLENGE

Product management is one of the hardest roles to evaluate. There's no code to review, no designs to critique. The work is invisible until it ships — or doesn't.

The challenge: PM candidates are often great interviewers. They're articulate, confident, and know the right frameworks. But frameworks don't ship products.

**Common hiring mistakes:**

- **Framework worship.** Testing if they know RICE or MoSCoW instead of whether they can prioritize under real constraints.
- **Ignoring execution.** Strategy is easy to talk about. Getting engineering, design, and stakeholders aligned is the hard part.
- **Skipping technical depth.** PMs don't code, but they need to understand technical trade-offs to make good decisions.
- **Missing customer obsession.** PMs who talk about users abstractly vs. PMs who've actually talked to them are very different.

## FAQ

**How long does the PM assessment take?**
40-50 minutes. Mix of video responses (product sense, stakeholder scenarios) and written responses (prioritization, spec writing).

**What about APM vs. senior PM roles?**
Adjust dimension weights and question difficulty based on level. More execution focus for APMs, more strategy for senior.

**Do you test case studies?**
Our assessment includes product sense questions that function as mini-cases. For deeper case evaluation, use alongside dedicated case interviews.

**How does this compare to PM interviews at FAANG?**
Similar rigor, structured format. LayersRank standardizes the evaluation so you get consistent signal across candidates.
