## THE DATA SCIENCE HIRING CHALLENGE

Data science sits between engineering, statistics, and business. The best data scientists combine technical depth with business acumen. Many have one without the other.

The challenge: data science interviews often test Kaggle skills that don't translate to real work. Candidates optimize metrics in isolation without understanding business context.

**Common hiring mistakes:**

- **Algorithm trivia.** Testing if they can derive backprop by hand instead of whether they can choose the right model for the problem.
- **Ignoring business translation.** Technical brilliance that can't be communicated to stakeholders has zero impact.
- **Skipping experimental rigor.** A/B testing, statistical significance, causal inference — the foundation of trustworthy insights.
- **Missing deployment thinking.** Models that can't be productionized stay in notebooks forever.

## SAMPLE DATA SCIENTIST QUESTIONS

### Technical Questions

**1. Walk me through how you would approach a problem where you need to predict customer churn. What would your process be from problem framing to deployment?**

*What this reveals:* End-to-end thinking, model selection rationale, deployment awareness.

**2. You've built a model with 95% accuracy, but stakeholders aren't satisfied. What might be happening?**

*What this reveals:* Understanding of metric limitations, stakeholder alignment, business thinking.

**3. How do you decide between a simple interpretable model and a complex black-box model?**

*What this reveals:* Trade-off reasoning, understanding of business context, pragmatism.

### Behavioral Questions

**4. Tell me about a time your analysis led to a decision you disagreed with. How did you handle it?**

*What this reveals:* Influence skills, intellectual honesty, handling disagreement.

**5. Describe a situation where you had to explain a complex analysis to non-technical stakeholders. What was your approach?**

*What this reveals:* Communication skills, ability to simplify, business orientation.

## DATA SCIENTIST EVALUATION CRITERIA

| Competency | What Great Looks Like | Red Flags |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Statistical Rigor** | Proper experimental design, understands uncertainty, causal thinking | P-hacking, no uncertainty quantification, correlation = causation |
| **ML Intuition** | Chooses appropriate models, aware of overfitting, practical | Throws complex models at everything, no baseline comparison |
| **Business Translation** | Frames in business terms, recommends actions, quantifies impact | Lost in technical details, no "so what", can't simplify |
| **Collaboration** | Works well with eng/product, influences without authority | Ivory tower, dismissive of non-DS, can't productionize |
| **Intellectual Honesty** | Acknowledges limitations, admits mistakes, quantifies uncertainty | Oversells findings, hides uncertainty, never wrong |

---

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Configure your data science assessment** — Adjust for your use cases (analytics, ML, experimentation)
2. **Invite candidates** — They complete the assessment async (40-50 min)
3. **Review reports** — See scores with confidence intervals across all dimensions
4. **Make better decisions** — Know exactly where candidates excel or need probing

**Time to first assessment:** Under 10 minutes

## FAQ

**How long does the data science assessment take?**
40-50 minutes. Mix of video responses (problem framing, stakeholder communication) and written responses (technical approach, analysis).

**Do you test coding skills?**
We evaluate coding approach and thinking, but we're not a HackerRank replacement. For pure coding assessment, use specialized tools alongside LayersRank.

**What about ML engineering vs. analytics roles?**
Adjust dimension weights based on your role. More technical for ML engineering, more business translation for analytics.

**How does this compare to take-home case studies?**
LayersRank is faster (40-50 min vs. hours/days) and evaluates communication alongside technical skill. Many teams use LayersRank first, then short case study for finalists.
