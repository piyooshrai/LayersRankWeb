## THE EM HIRING CHALLENGE

Engineering managers must be strong enough technically to earn respect, strong enough interpersonally to develop people, and strong enough operationally to deliver results. Finding all three is rare.

The challenge: EMs come from different backgrounds. Some are great engineers who struggle with people. Some are great people managers without technical credibility. Both fail.

**Common hiring mistakes:**

- **Technical-only evaluation.** Testing system design while ignoring whether they can run a 1:1 or deliver feedback.
- **Management theory over practice.** Knowing about situational leadership doesn't mean they can actually adapt their style.
- **Ignoring delivery.** Teams can be happy and well-managed without shipping. That's a problem.
- **Skipping the team building lens.** EMs hire, grow, and sometimes exit team members. This requires specific skills.

## FAQ

**How long does the EM assessment take?**
45-60 minutes. Mix of video responses (management scenarios, feedback delivery) and written responses (planning, process).

Similar structure, standardized evaluation. LayersRank ensures consistent assessment across candidates.
