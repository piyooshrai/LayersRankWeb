## THE DEVOPS HIRING CHALLENGE

DevOps sits at the intersection of development and operations. It requires deep technical skills plus communication, process thinking, and the ability to work under pressure.

The challenge: DevOps skills are broad and constantly evolving. Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, GCP, monitoring, security — the landscape is vast.

**Common hiring mistakes:**

- **Tool obsession.** Testing Kubernetes YAML syntax instead of infrastructure thinking. Tools change; principles don't.
- **Ignoring soft skills.** DevOps engineers work with every team. Communication and collaboration matter as much as technical ability.
- **Skipping incident response.** Anyone can build pipelines in calm conditions. The job is often 3 AM production fires.
- **Missing security awareness.** DevOps owns the security perimeter. A DevOps engineer without security thinking is a liability.

## SAMPLE DEVOPS QUESTIONS

### Technical Questions

**1. Walk me through how you would design a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application. What stages would you include and why?**

*What this reveals:* Pipeline design thinking, understanding of testing/deployment stages, security integration awareness.

**2. Your monitoring shows a gradual increase in memory usage on production servers over the past week. How would you investigate?**

*What this reveals:* Debugging methodology, observability tool familiarity, systematic approach.

**3. How do you balance developer velocity with operational stability?**

*What this reveals:* Philosophy on DevOps role, understanding of trade-offs, collaboration mindset.

### Behavioral Questions

**4. Tell me about a significant production incident you handled. What was your process, and what did you learn?**

*What this reveals:* Incident response skills, ability to stay calm, learning orientation.

**5. Describe a time you had to push back on a developer's request that would have caused operational problems.**

*What this reveals:* Communication skills, ability to say no constructively, technical judgment.

## DEVOPS EVALUATION CRITERIA

| Competency | What Great Looks Like | Red Flags |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Infrastructure Design** | Considers reliability, cost, security from start | Over-engineers, ignores cost, no failure mode thinking |
| **Automation** | Automates deliberately, documents well, considers maintenance | Automates everything blindly, no documentation, brittle scripts |
| **Incident Response** | Stays calm, communicates clearly, learns from incidents | Panics, blames others, no post-mortems |
| **Collaboration** | Builds self-service tools, explains constraints well | Gatekeeps, dismissive of developers, no documentation |
| **Security** | Security-first thinking, least privilege, audit awareness | Security as afterthought, overly permissive access |

---

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Configure your DevOps assessment** — Adjust for your cloud provider and tooling
2. **Invite candidates** — They complete the assessment async (35-45 min)
3. **Review reports** — See scores with confidence intervals across all dimensions
4. **Make better decisions** — Know exactly where candidates excel or need probing

**Time to first assessment:** Under 10 minutes

## FAQ

**How long does the DevOps assessment take?**
35-45 minutes. Mix of video responses (incident scenarios, design discussions) and written responses (technical explanations).

**What if we use specific tools (Terraform, Ansible, etc.)?**
The default assessment focuses on principles. You can customize to add tool-specific questions.

**Do you evaluate cloud-specific knowledge?**
We include questions that can be answered across AWS/GCP/Azure. You can customize for your specific cloud.

**How do you assess incident response ability?**
Through scenario-based questions about past incidents and hypothetical situations. We evaluate their process and communication, not just technical knowledge.
