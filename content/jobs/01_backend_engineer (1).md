## THE BACKEND HIRING CHALLENGE

Backend engineers are the foundation of your technical architecture. A great backend engineer builds systems that scale, perform, and remain maintainable. A poor one creates technical debt that compounds for years.

The problem: backend skills are hard to evaluate in traditional interviews. A candidate can discuss microservices fluently without ever having built one. They can whiteboard a system design without understanding the operational reality.

**Common hiring mistakes:**

- **Testing syntax, not judgment.** Fizzbuzz doesn't tell you if they can design an API.
- **Focusing on current stack.** Good engineers learn technologies. Great engineers make good decisions regardless of stack.
- **Ignoring debugging ability.** Anyone can build greenfield. The job is often debugging, optimizing, and maintaining.
- **Skipping behavioral evaluation.** Backend engineers work with frontend teams, product managers, and ops. Collaboration matters.

- Data modeling decisions

**API Architecture**
- RESTful design principles
- Error handling philosophy
- Versioning and backward compatibility

**Debugging & Operations**
- Systematic troubleshooting approach
- Production incident handling
- Performance optimization thinking

### Behavioral Dimension (35%)

**Technical Communication**
- Explaining complex systems to non-technical stakeholders
- Documentation practices
- Code review philosophy

**Collaboration**
- Working with frontend teams on API contracts
- Cross-functional coordination
- Handling disagreements on technical approach

**Ownership**
- Taking responsibility for system reliability
- Proactive problem identification
- On-call and incident response attitude

### Contextual Dimension (20%)

**Growth Trajectory**
- Learning approach for new technologies
- Career goals alignment
- Interest in the problem domain

## SAMPLE BACKEND ENGINEER QUESTIONS

### Technical Questions

**1. Walk me through how you would design an API rate limiting system. What trade-offs would you consider?**

*What this reveals:* System design thinking, awareness of distributed systems challenges, trade-off reasoning between precision and performance.

**2. You're debugging a production issue where API response times have suddenly increased by 10x. Walk me through your approach.**

*What this reveals:* Systematic debugging methodology, familiarity with observability tools, ability to stay calm under pressure.

**3. Describe a technical decision you made that you later regretted. What would you do differently?**

*What this reveals:* Self-awareness, learning orientation, intellectual honesty about mistakes.

### Behavioral Questions

**4. Tell me about a time you disagreed with a frontend engineer about API design. How did you handle it?**

*What this reveals:* Collaboration style, ability to advocate for technical positions while respecting other perspectives.

**5. Describe a situation where you had to maintain a system you didn't build. What was challenging?**

*What this reveals:* Attitude toward legacy code, documentation practices, empathy for future maintainers.

## BACKEND ENGINEER EVALUATION CRITERIA

| Competency | What Great Looks Like | Red Flags |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **System Design** | Considers multiple approaches, articulates trade-offs clearly, thinks about failure modes | Jumps to solution without analysis, ignores scale, no awareness of operational concerns |
| **Code Quality** | Discusses maintainability, testing strategy, documentation | Only talks about making it work, dismissive of code review |
| **Debugging** | Systematic approach, uses data, isolates variables | Random trial-and-error, blames external factors |
| **Collaboration** | Seeks to understand other perspectives, communicates clearly | Dismissive of frontend concerns, poor documentation attitude |
| **Ownership** | Takes responsibility for reliability, proactive about issues | "Not my problem" attitude, avoids on-call |

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Configure your backend assessment** — Use our template or customize for your stack
2. **Invite candidates** — They complete the assessment async (35-45 min)
3. **Review reports** — See scores with confidence intervals across all dimensions
4. **Make better decisions** — Know exactly where to probe in final rounds

**Time to first assessment:** Under 10 minutes

## FAQ

**How long does the backend assessment take candidates?**
35-45 minutes. Mix of video responses (system design, debugging scenarios) and written responses (technical explanations).

**What if we use a specific tech stack?**
The default assessment focuses on language-agnostic backend concepts. You can customize to include stack-specific questions.

**How does this compare to HackerRank or Codility?**
Those test coding speed. LayersRank evaluates engineering judgment. Different signals — many teams use both.

**Can we see the questions before inviting candidates?**
Yes. Full preview available after signup.
