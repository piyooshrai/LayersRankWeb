## THE DATA ENGINEERING HIRING CHALLENGE

Data engineering is infrastructure for analytics. A great data engineer builds pipelines that are reliable, maintainable, and trusted. A poor one creates data swamps where nothing is reliable.

The challenge: data engineering requires both software engineering rigor and domain understanding. Many candidates have one but not both.

**Common hiring mistakes:**

- **SQL-only evaluation.** Testing query writing but not pipeline thinking. Queries are one component; orchestration, quality, and reliability are the rest.
- **Ignoring data quality.** Anyone can move data from A to B. The job is ensuring it arrives correctly, completely, on time.
- **Skipping stakeholder communication.** Data engineers work with analysts, scientists, and business users. Communication matters.
- **Tool focus over principles.** Airflow vs. Dagster vs. Prefect doesn't matter if they can't design a good DAG.

## SAMPLE DATA ENGINEER QUESTIONS

### Technical Questions

**1. Walk me through how you would design a data pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and makes it available for analytics. What would you prioritize?**

*What this reveals:* Pipeline architecture thinking, understanding of orchestration patterns, quality considerations.

**2. You discover that a table analysts depend on has had incorrect data for the past week. How do you handle it?**

*What this reveals:* Incident response, stakeholder communication, backfill strategies.

**3. How do you decide between batch and streaming processing for a given use case?**

*What this reveals:* Understanding of trade-offs, awareness of complexity costs, pragmatism.

### Behavioral Questions

**4. Tell me about a time you had to push back on a request from a data analyst or scientist. How did you handle it?**

*What this reveals:* Stakeholder management, ability to say no constructively, collaboration style.

**5. Describe a data quality issue you identified and fixed. How did you prevent it from recurring?**

*What this reveals:* Quality mindset, systematic thinking, proactive problem-solving.

## DATA ENGINEER EVALUATION CRITERIA

| Competency | What Great Looks Like | Red Flags |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Pipeline Design** | Idempotent, testable, well-orchestrated pipelines | Brittle scripts, no retry logic, no monitoring |
| **Data Modeling** | Appropriate modeling for use case, documented, versioned | Over-normalized, undocumented, no schema evolution strategy |
| **Data Quality** | Tests for data, monitors for anomalies, handles edge cases | Assumes data is clean, no testing, no monitoring |
| **Stakeholder Mgmt** | Understands needs, communicates clearly, manages expectations | Dismissive of "business people", no documentation |
| **Reliability** | Treats data as production, SLAs, on-call ownership | "It's just data", no ownership of reliability |

---

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Configure your data engineering assessment** — Adjust for your stack and use cases
2. **Invite candidates** — They complete the assessment async (35-45 min)
3. **Review reports** — See scores with confidence intervals across all dimensions
4. **Make better decisions** — Know exactly where candidates excel or need probing

**Time to first assessment:** Under 10 minutes

## FAQ

**How long does the data engineering assessment take?**
35-45 minutes. Mix of video responses (pipeline design, incident scenarios) and written responses (SQL, technical explanations).

**Do you test SQL skills?**
We include questions that require SQL reasoning, but we're evaluating query design thinking more than syntax recall.

**What about specific tools (Spark, Airflow, dbt)?**
Default assessment focuses on principles. You can customize to add tool-specific questions.

**How does this compare to SQL take-home tests?**
LayersRank evaluates pipeline thinking, data quality mindset, and communication — not just query writing. Different signals.
