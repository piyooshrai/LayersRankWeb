## THE QA HIRING CHALLENGE

QA has evolved from manual testers to quality engineers who code, automate, and shift quality left. But many candidates are stuck in the old model.

The challenge: finding QA engineers who can write automation, think strategically about quality, and collaborate effectively with development teams.

**Common hiring mistakes:**

- **Manual-only evaluation.** Testing if they can write test cases but not automation code.
- **Ignoring strategic thinking.** Good QA engineers don't just test — they shape the testing strategy.
- **Skipping collaboration skills.** QA works with everyone. Adversarial QA relationships slow everyone down.
- **Missing prevention mindset.** Finding bugs is good. Preventing them is better.

## SAMPLE QA ENGINEER QUESTIONS

### Technical Questions

**1. Walk me through how you would design a test strategy for a new feature. What types of testing would you include and why?**

*What this reveals:* Strategic thinking, test pyramid understanding, risk assessment.

**2. You have limited time before a release. How do you decide what to test?**

*What this reveals:* Prioritization, risk-based thinking, pragmatism.

**3. Describe your approach to automating a test suite. What factors influence your decisions?**

*What this reveals:* Automation philosophy, maintainability thinking, ROI awareness.

### Behavioral Questions

**4. Tell me about a time you found a critical bug late in the release cycle. How did you handle the communication?**

*What this reveals:* Communication skills, handling pressure, stakeholder management.

**5. Describe a situation where you disagreed with a developer about whether something was a bug. How did you resolve it?**

## QA ENGINEER EVALUATION CRITERIA

| Competency | What Great Looks Like | Red Flags |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Test Strategy** | Risk-based approach, understands trade-offs, plans coverage | Tests everything equally, no strategy, reactive only |
| **Automation** | Clean test code, maintainable frameworks, CI/CD integrated | Brittle tests, copy-paste automation, no CI/CD |
| **Quality Advocacy** | Shifts quality left, influences culture, educates team | Finds bugs only, adversarial, gatekeeper mentality |
| **Collaboration** | Partners with devs, communicates clearly, respected | "Us vs. them", unclear bug reports, avoided |
| **Problem-Solving** | Finds root cause, reproduces reliably, suggests fixes | Surface-level reporting, can't reproduce, no analysis |

---

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Configure your QA assessment** — Adjust for manual, automation, or SDET focus
2. **Invite candidates** — They complete the assessment async (35-45 min)
3. **Review reports** — See scores with confidence intervals across all dimensions
4. **Make better decisions** — Know exactly where candidates excel or need probing

**Time to first assessment:** Under 10 minutes

## FAQ

**How long does the QA assessment take?**
35-45 minutes. Mix of video responses (testing strategy, bug triage scenarios) and written responses (test case design, automation approach).

**What about manual vs. automation roles?**
Adjust dimension weights. More automation focus for SDET roles, more strategy and exploratory for manual-heavy roles.

**Do you test coding skills?**
We evaluate automation approach and thinking. For deep coding assessment, use alongside specialized tools.

**How does this compare to test case exercises?**
LayersRank evaluates strategic thinking and collaboration alongside technical skill — not just test case writing ability.
