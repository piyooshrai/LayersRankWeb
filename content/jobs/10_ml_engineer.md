## THE ML ENGINEERING HIRING CHALLENGE

ML engineering sits between data science and software engineering. ML engineers take models from notebooks to production — and keep them running reliably.

The challenge: many candidates are strong in either ML theory or software engineering, but not both. Production ML requires both.

**Common hiring mistakes:**

- **Research focus over production.** Testing ML theory while ignoring whether they can deploy and monitor models.
- **Ignoring software engineering.** ML code is still code. Bad engineering practices create technical debt.
- **Skipping MLOps thinking.** Training is 10% of the work. Deployment, monitoring, and retraining are the rest.
- **Missing collaboration skills.** ML engineers work with data scientists, data engineers, and product teams.

## SAMPLE ML ENGINEER QUESTIONS

### Technical Questions

**1. Walk me through how you would take a model from a data scientist's notebook to production. What steps would you follow?**

*What this reveals:* Production ML understanding, deployment patterns, collaboration approach.

**2. A model in production has started performing worse than when it was trained. How would you diagnose and address this?**

*What this reveals:* Model degradation understanding, monitoring philosophy, debugging approach.

**3. How do you decide between serving a model as a batch job vs. a real-time API?**

*What this reveals:* Architecture trade-off thinking, latency/cost awareness, pragmatism.

### Behavioral Questions

**4. Tell me about a time you had to push back on a data scientist's model because it wasn't production-ready. How did you handle it?**

*What this reveals:* Collaboration skills, production standards, communication.

**5. Describe a production ML issue you debugged. What was the process and what did you learn?**

*What this reveals:* Debugging methodology, learning orientation, production experience depth.

## ML ENGINEER EVALUATION CRITERIA

| Competency | What Great Looks Like | Red Flags |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **ML Fundamentals** | Solid understanding, appropriate model selection, knows limitations | Chases SOTA, doesn't understand basics, no evaluation rigor |
| **Software Engineering** | Clean code, tested, well-architected systems | Research code in production, no tests, poor architecture |
| **MLOps** | Automated pipelines, monitoring, retraining strategies | Manual deployments, no monitoring, no versioning |
| **Production Thinking** | Cost/latency aware, scalability focus, reliability mindset | Ignores production concerns, notebook-to-production gaps |
| **Collaboration** | Works well across teams, communicates trade-offs clearly | Siloed, dismissive of constraints, poor handoffs |

---

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Configure your ML engineer assessment** — Adjust focus for MLOps, research, or full-stack ML
2. **Invite candidates** — They complete the assessment async (40-50 min)
3. **Review reports** — See scores with confidence intervals across all dimensions
4. **Make better decisions** — Know exactly where candidates excel or need probing

**Time to first assessment:** Under 10 minutes

## FAQ

**How long does the ML engineer assessment take?**
40-50 minutes. Mix of video responses (system design, production scenarios) and written responses (technical explanations).

**What about ML research roles?**
LayersRank is focused on production ML engineering. For pure research roles, you may need different evaluation approaches.

**Do you test deep learning specifically?**
Default assessment covers ML broadly. You can customize for deep learning, NLP, computer vision, or other specializations.

**How does this compare to ML system design interviews?**
Similar rigor, standardized format. LayersRank evaluates the same skills but with consistent scoring across candidates.
