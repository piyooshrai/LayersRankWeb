## WHY TEAMS SWITCH FROM HIREVUE

### The HireVue Reality

HireVue pioneered video interviewing. But for many teams — especially those outside the US Fortune 500 — it's become the wrong tool:

**Pricing that doesn't scale down.** HireVue's enterprise contracts start at $35,000+ annually. If you're hiring 50-200 people per year, you're paying for capacity you'll never use.

**US-centric design.** Evaluation models trained primarily on US candidates. Cultural communication patterns from India, Southeast Asia, or the Middle East may be misparsed.

**Black-box scoring.** A number comes out. You don't know why. Can't explain it to candidates. Can't defend it in audits. Can't improve your process based on it.

**No confidence indicators.** HireVue gives you a score. LayersRank gives you a score plus how confident we are in that score. Big difference when making hiring decisions.

## WHAT YOU GET WITH LAYERSRANK

### Confidence-Weighted Scoring

HireVue says "this candidate scored 72." Is that a confident 72 or an uncertain 72?

LayersRank says "this candidate scored 72 ± 4 with 89% confidence." You know exactly how much to trust the score — and when to dig deeper.

### Adaptive Follow-Up

When a candidate's answer is ambiguous, LayersRank doesn't guess. It asks a follow-up question to clarify. This reduces false positives and false negatives.

HireVue evaluates what it gets. LayersRank gets what it needs to evaluate.

### Transparent Evaluation

Every LayersRank score breaks down into dimensions: Technical, Behavioral, Contextual. You see why the score is what it is. You can explain it to stakeholders and candidates.

No black boxes. No "trust us" scoring.

### India-First Design

LayersRank is built for India's hiring reality:

- **Data residency in Mumbai** — compliance with data localization requirements
- **Evaluation models trained on Indian candidates** — understands Indian English, communication patterns, and educational context
- **Pricing in INR** — no exchange rate surprises
- **Support in your timezone** — not waiting for US business hours

## WHO SWITCHES

**GCCs tired of US pricing for India hiring.** HireVue's enterprise model doesn't fit India's cost structure. LayersRank does.

**Startups who outgrew HireVue's SMB offering.** Need real AI evaluation, not just video recording. But don't need enterprise contracts.

**Teams who need explainability.** For compliance, for stakeholder buy-in, or just for better decisions.

**Anyone paying for unused capacity.** If your HireVue contract covers 10,000 assessments and you use 500, you're overpaying by 95%.

## FAQ

**Is LayersRank as accurate as HireVue?**

Our evaluation models show 0.83 correlation with expert human evaluation — comparable to or better than published benchmarks for similar tools. More importantly, our confidence scoring tells you when to trust the score and when to verify.

**Can I use my existing HireVue questions?**

Yes. You can import questions or we'll help you recreate them. Our question framework may suggest improvements based on what we've learned works.

**What about HireVue's game-based assessments?**

We don't offer game-based assessments. Research on their validity is mixed. We focus on structured interviews with proven predictive validity.
