## THE CODILITY LIMITATION

### What Codility Does Well

Codility excels at automated coding tests:
- Timed algorithm challenges
- Multiple language support
- Automated correctness checking
- Plagiarism detection

For filtering large applicant pools on basic coding ability, it works.

### What Codility Misses

**Technical judgment.** Can they choose the right approach, not just implement one?

**Problem-solving process.** How do they break down ambiguous problems? How do they handle being stuck?

**Communication.** Can they explain their thinking? Collaborate with teammates?

**Behavioral signals.** How do they handle feedback? Learn from mistakes?

## FAQ

**Is LayersRank as rigorous technically?**
Different rigor. Codility tests implementation speed. LayersRank tests technical judgment. Both matter.

**Can candidates cheat?**
Our integrity system monitors keystrokes, copy-paste, timing. Suspicious behavior flagged in reports.

**What about great engineers who are bad at timed tests?**
They often do better on LayersRank. We evaluate thinking, not speed.
