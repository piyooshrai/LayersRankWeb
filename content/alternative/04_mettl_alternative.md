## WHY TEAMS LOOK BEYOND METTL

### Mettl's Strengths

Mettl (now Mercer Mettl) has been in India's assessment market for years:
- Large test library
- Proctoring capabilities
- Enterprise presence
- Psychometric assessments

### Where Mettl Falls Short

**Dated candidate experience.** The interface feels old. Candidates notice. Your employer brand suffers.

**Scores without context.** You get a number. Is it reliable? Where's the uncertainty? You don't know.

**Configuration complexity.** Setting up assessments requires training. Too many options, not enough guidance.

**Generic assessments.** One-size-fits-all tests that don't adapt to your specific roles or evaluation criteria.

**No adaptive follow-up.** If a candidate's answer is ambiguous, Mettl can't ask for clarification. It just scores what it got.

| Capability | Mettl | LayersRank |

| **AI evaluation** | Basic | Advanced with confidence scoring |
| **Confidence intervals** | No | Yes — every score |
| **Adaptive follow-up** | No | Yes |
| **Score explainability** | Limited | Full dimension breakdown |
| **Candidate UX** | Dated | Modern |
| **Setup complexity** | High | Low |
| **Custom role configuration** | Complex | Simple |
| **Proctoring** | Yes | Yes + integrity scoring |
| **India-first** | Yes | Yes |

## THE CONFIDENCE DIFFERENCE

### Mettl Output

```
Candidate Score: 72/100
Percentile: 68th
Recommendation: Consider for next round
```

What does 72 mean? How reliable is it? Should you trust it for a borderline candidate? Mettl doesn't say.

### LayersRank Output

```
Overall Score: 72 ± 5 (81% confidence)

Technical: 78 ± 3 (high confidence)
- Strong system thinking
- Good debugging approach
- Minor gaps in scalability knowledge

Behavioral: 65 ± 7 (medium confidence)
- Collaboration examples were vague
- Consider follow-up on conflict resolution
- Growth mindset indicators positive

Recommendation: Advance with targeted follow-up on behavioral dimension
```

## WHO SWITCHES FROM METTL

**HR leaders frustrated with complexity.** Spent too much time configuring assessments, not enough time on results.

**Talent teams focused on candidate experience.** The old interface was hurting their employer brand.

**Teams scaling quickly.** Need something that works out of the box without consultant support.
