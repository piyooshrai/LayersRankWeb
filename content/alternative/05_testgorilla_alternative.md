## HERO

**Eyebrow:** TESTGORILLA ALTERNATIVE

**Headline:** Skills Tests Show What They Know. Not How They Work.

**Subhead:** TestGorilla tells you candidates have skills. LayersRank tells you if they'll use them well. Technical judgment, collaboration, problem-solving approach — the complete picture.

## TESTGORILLA'S APPROACH

### What TestGorilla Does

TestGorilla offers a library of skills tests:
- Cognitive ability tests
- Software skills tests
- Language proficiency
- Personality assessments
- Role-specific tests

It's a test library. Pick tests, send to candidates, get scores.

### The Limitation

**Tests measure knowledge, not application.** Knowing JavaScript syntax doesn't mean you can build maintainable systems.

**No adaptive depth.** Every candidate gets the same questions regardless of their answers. Can't probe deeper on interesting responses.

**Scores without confidence.** A "75" could be reliable or noisy. TestGorilla doesn't tell you.

**Limited behavioral signal.** Personality tests are weak predictors. Structured behavioral interviews are strong predictors. TestGorilla does the former. LayersRank does the latter.

**Generic, not role-specific.** Same JavaScript test for frontend, backend, and full-stack roles — even though the job requirements differ.

## DIFFERENT TOOLS, DIFFERENT SIGNALS

### TestGorilla Tells You

- Candidate knows Python syntax
- Scored 80th percentile on cognitive ability
- Personality profile suggests introversion

### LayersRank Tells You

- Candidate demonstrates strong technical judgment when discussing system design trade-offs
- Shows thoughtful problem-solving approach — asks clarifying questions, considers edge cases
- Communication is clear but could be more concise
- Behavioral examples suggest growth mindset but limited collaboration experience
- Confidence: 84% — reliable signal
- Recommendation: Strong technical, probe on collaboration in final round

### Which Do You Want?

TestGorilla confirms they have skills. LayersRank predicts they'll succeed in the role.

## THE BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT GAP

### Personality Tests (TestGorilla)

- Based on self-report
- Easy to game
- Weak predictive validity (r = 0.15-0.20)
- "Are you a team player?" → Everyone says yes

### Structured Behavioral Interviews (LayersRank)

- Based on past behavior examples
- Hard to fake depth
- Strong predictive validity (r = 0.50+)
- "Tell me about a specific conflict with a colleague" → Reveals actual patterns

Research consistently shows structured interviews predict job performance 2-3x better than personality assessments.

## WHEN TO USE WHAT

### TestGorilla Works For

- High-volume screening where any signal helps
- Roles where specific skills (Excel, typing, language) are pass/fail requirements
- Augmenting other evaluation methods

### LayersRank Works For

- Evaluating whether to hire, not just whether to consider
- Roles where judgment and collaboration matter
- Teams who want defensible, explainable decisions
- Replacing multiple interview rounds with structured assessment

### The Key Question

Are you testing skills or evaluating people?

Skills testing is a filter. People evaluation is a decision.

## PRICING

### TestGorilla
- Free tier available (limited)
- Paid plans from ~$75/month
- Per-candidate pricing at scale

### LayersRank
- ₹2,500/assessment (Starter)
- ₹1,600-2,000/assessment (Growth)
- No subscription — pay per use

**For serious hiring decisions:**

TestGorilla is cheaper for high-volume skills screening.

LayersRank is more valuable when you need complete candidate evaluation — the kind that replaces interview rounds, not just filters resumes.

---

## WHO SWITCHES FROM TESTGORILLA

**Teams hiring for judgment-heavy roles.** Engineering, product, leadership — where skills are table stakes and judgment is the differentiator.

**Hiring managers frustrated with false positives.** Candidates who test well but don't perform. Skills ≠ success.

**Leaders who need to explain decisions.** "They scored 78 on the JavaScript test" isn't a hiring rationale. "Their technical judgment is strong, they show growth mindset, and their collaboration examples were compelling" is.

**Anyone supplementing skills tests with manual interviews.** LayersRank consolidates the behavioral piece into a structured, scalable process.

---

## FAQ

**Is LayersRank a replacement for TestGorilla?**

Depends on what you use TestGorilla for. For skills verification (does this person know Excel?), TestGorilla works. For complete candidate evaluation (should we hire this person?), LayersRank is more appropriate.

**What about TestGorilla's cognitive ability tests?**

We don't replicate cognitive ability tests. Our structured interview format naturally reveals problem-solving ability — which is what cognitive tests try to proxy anyway.

**Can I use both?**

Yes. TestGorilla for skills screening, LayersRank for complete evaluation of candidates who pass. Many teams do this.

**Does LayersRank have a test library?**

We have question templates for common roles, but our approach is structured interviews, not standardized tests. You evaluate how candidates think, not just what they know.
