## HERO

**Eyebrow:** HACKERRANK ALTERNATIVE

**Headline:** Coding Tests Tell You If They Can Code. Not If They Can Engineer.

**Subhead:** LayersRank evaluates the complete engineer — technical judgment, problem-solving approach, communication, collaboration — not just algorithm speed.

## THE HACKERRANK GAP

### What HackerRank Measures

HackerRank is excellent at one thing: testing if candidates can solve algorithmic problems under time pressure.

This tells you:
- They know data structures and algorithms
- They can code quickly
- They've practiced competitive programming

### What HackerRank Doesn't Measure

- **Technical judgment** — Can they choose the right solution, not just implement one?
- **System thinking** — Can they reason about trade-offs, scale, and maintenance?
- **Problem-solving approach** — How do they break down ambiguous problems?
- **Communication** — Can they explain their thinking to teammates?
- **Collaboration signals** — How do they respond to feedback, work with others?
- **Learning orientation** — Will they grow into the role?

### The Result

HackerRank gives you candidates who pass coding tests. Some become great engineers. Some are "LeetCode grinders" who struggle with real engineering work.

You've filtered out people who can't code. You haven't filtered in people who can engineer.

## HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPARISON

| Capability | HackerRank | LayersRank |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Algorithmic coding tests** | Excellent | Not our focus |
| **Technical judgment assessment** | Limited | Yes — system design, trade-off reasoning |
| **Behavioral evaluation** | No | Yes — full behavioral assessment |
| **Problem-solving approach** | Implicit | Explicit — see how they think |
| **Communication assessment** | No | Yes — video + text responses |
| **Confidence scoring** | No | Yes — know when to trust scores |
| **Adaptive follow-up** | No | Yes — clarifies ambiguous answers |
| **Cheating detection** | Basic | Advanced — keystroke, copy-paste, timing |
| **Evaluation explainability** | Score only | Full dimension breakdown |
| **Pricing** | Per test | Per assessment |

## DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT JOBS

### Use HackerRank When

- You need to verify basic coding ability at scale
- Algorithmic skill is the primary job requirement
- You're filtering 10,000 applicants to 1,000

### Use LayersRank When

- You need to evaluate engineering judgment, not just coding
- Behavioral fit matters as much as technical skill
- You want to predict job performance, not test performance
- You're evaluating 100-1,000 candidates for actual hiring decisions

### Use Both When

HackerRank as a first filter (can they code at all?), LayersRank for complete evaluation (should we hire them?).

## WHAT LAYERSRANK EVALUATES

### Technical Dimension

Not "can you invert a binary tree in 15 minutes" but:

- How do you approach a system design problem?
- What trade-offs do you consider?
- How do you debug production issues?
- How do you think about code maintainability?
- Can you explain technical concepts clearly?

### Behavioral Dimension

- How do you respond to critical feedback?
- Tell me about a technical decision you regret.
- How do you handle ambiguous requirements?
- Describe a conflict with a colleague and how you resolved it.

### Contextual Dimension

- Why this role? Why now?
- What's your ideal working environment?
- How do you approach learning new technologies?

### The Output

A score with confidence interval, broken down by dimension, with full explanation of why.

Not "78/100 on medium difficulty" but "Technical: 82 ± 3 (high confidence), Behavioral: 71 ± 5 (medium confidence), key strength in system thinking, potential gap in stakeholder communication."

## PRICING COMPARISON

### HackerRank

- Per-test pricing: ~$25-50 per test
- Platform fees vary
- Enterprise contracts for volume

### LayersRank

- ₹2,500/assessment (Starter)
- ₹1,600-2,000/assessment (Growth)
- Complete evaluation (technical + behavioral)

**For complete evaluation:**

| Approach | What You Get | Cost per Candidate |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| HackerRank only | Coding test | ~$30-50 |
| HackerRank + manual behavioral | Coding test + unstructured interviews | ~$30 + interviewer time |
| LayersRank | Complete structured evaluation | ₹2,000-2,500 (~$24-30) |

LayersRank costs roughly the same as HackerRank alone — but includes behavioral assessment that would otherwise require hours of interviewer time.

## THE ENGINEERING EVALUATION STACK

### Traditional Stack

```
Resume Screen
    ↓
HackerRank Coding Test
    ↓
Phone Screen (technical)
    ↓
Phone Screen (behavioral)
    ↓
On-site (4-6 interviews)
    ↓
Offer
```

**Total interviewer time:** 8-12 hours per candidate who reaches on-site
**Signal quality:** Variable (depends on interviewers)

### LayersRank Stack

```
Resume Screen
    ↓
LayersRank Assessment (technical + behavioral)
    ↓
Report Review (10 min)
    ↓
Focused Final Round (2-3 interviews)
    ↓
Offer
```

**Total interviewer time:** 3-4 hours per candidate who reaches final round
**Signal quality:** Consistent (same evaluation for every candidate)

---

## WHO SWITCHES

**Engineering managers tired of LeetCode grinders.** Candidates who ace HackerRank but struggle with real engineering work.

**Teams who value behavioral fit.** Technical ability is necessary but not sufficient. Culture, collaboration, and growth mindset matter.

**Leaders who want defensible decisions.** "They scored well on HackerRank" isn't a complete hiring rationale.

**Anyone doing both coding tests AND behavioral interviews.** LayersRank consolidates into one structured assessment.

## FAQ

**Should I stop using HackerRank?**

Not necessarily. If algorithmic skill is critical for your roles, HackerRank is excellent for that. Use it as a first filter, then use LayersRank for complete evaluation of candidates who pass.

**Does LayersRank test coding?**

We assess technical judgment and problem-solving through structured questions — but we don't provide timed coding environments like HackerRank. We evaluate how they think about technical problems, not just whether they can implement solutions quickly.

**What about competitive programmers?**

Great competitive programmers may score highly on both HackerRank and LayersRank. But LayersRank will also identify their communication skills, collaboration approach, and growth mindset — things HackerRank can't see.

**Can candidates cheat on LayersRank?**

Our integrity detection monitors keystroke patterns, copy-paste events, tab switches, and response timing. We can't prevent all cheating, but we flag suspicious behavior and factor it into confidence scores.
