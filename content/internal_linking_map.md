# Internal Linking Strategy
## LayersRank Site Architecture & Link Map

---

## LINK STRATEGY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Hub-and-Spoke Model
- Hub pages link to all related spoke pages
- Spoke pages link back to hub and to 2-3 related spokes
- Creates topical clusters that signal authority to search engines

### 2. Contextual Links
- Links within body copy (not just navigation)
- Natural anchor text that includes keywords
- Links where they provide value to reader

### 3. Priority Pages
- Homepage links to all major hubs
- High-value pages get more internal links
- Link equity flows to conversion pages

## ANCHOR TEXT STRATEGY

### Primary Keywords (use sparingly, vary)
- "confidence-weighted scoring"
- "structured interviews"
- "AI hiring platform"
- "candidate evaluation"

### Branded Terms
- "LayersRank"
- "LayersRank assessment"

### Natural Variations
- "learn more about confidence scoring"
- "see how structured interviews work"
- "calculate your hiring ROI"
- "explore our technical hiring solution"

### Avoid
- "click here"
- "read more"
- "this page"
- Over-optimized exact match anchors

---

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### For Each New Page:
- [ ] Add 3-5 contextual internal links in body copy
- [ ] Link to 1-2 related pages in same cluster
- [ ] Link to 1 page in different cluster (cross-linking)
- [ ] Include link to relevant lead magnet
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation
- [ ] Update hub page to include new page

### For Existing Pages:
- [ ] Audit for internal linking opportunities
- [ ] Add links to new content
- [ ] Fix any broken internal links
- [ ] Ensure all pages have at least 3 internal links pointing to them

### Monthly Audit:
- [ ] Check for orphan pages (no internal links pointing to them)
- [ ] Identify pages with high external links, ensure they link to priority pages
- [ ] Review anchor text distribution
- [ ] Update links in older content to newer pages

---

## PRIORITY PAGES (Need Most Internal Links)

1. **Pricing** — Conversion page
2. **Product/Confidence Scoring** — Key differentiator
3. **Solutions/GCC** — High-value segment
4. **Solutions/Technical Hiring** — High-intent topic
5. **Lead Magnets** — Email capture

Ensure these pages receive internal links from at least 10+ other pages.

---

## LINK INSERTION TEMPLATE

When writing content, use this pattern:

**In introductions:**
"LayersRank's [confidence-weighted scoring](/product/confidence-scoring) ensures you know exactly how much to trust each evaluation."

**In feature descriptions:**
"This integrates with our [adaptive follow-up system](/product/adaptive-follow-up) to gather more information when needed."

**In conclusions:**
"Ready to see it in action? [Calculate your potential ROI](/resources/roi-calculator) or [start your free trial](/pricing)."

**In related topics:**
"For technical roles, see our guide to [hiring backend engineers](/hire/backend-engineer)."
